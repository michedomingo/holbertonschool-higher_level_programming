# 0x03. Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

<details><summary>Project Requirements ☑️</summary>


#### Python Scripts
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of this project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.*)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using wc
#### C Scripts
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
- Your programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
- All your files should end with a new line
- Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
- You are not allowed to use global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
- The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called lists.h
- Don’t forget to push your header file
- All your header files should be include guarded

### [0. Print a list of integers](./0-print_list_integer.py)
* Write a function that prints all integers of a list.


### [1. Secure access to an element in a list](./1-element_at.py)
* Write a function that retrieves an element from a list like in C.


### [2. Replace element](./2-replace_in_list.py)
* Write a function that replaces an element of a list at a specific position (like in C).


### [3. Print a list of integers... in reverse!](./3-print_reversed_list_integer.py)
* Write a function that prints all integers of a list, in reverse order.


### [4. Replace in a copy](./4-new_in_list.py)
* Write a function that replaces an element in a list at a specific position without modifying the original list (like in C).


### [5. Can you C me now?](./5-no_c.py)
* Write a function that removes all characters c and C from a string.


### [6. Lists of lists = Matrix](./6-print_matrix_integer.py)
* Write a function that prints a matrix of integers.


### [7. Tuples addition](./7-add_tuple.py)
* Write a function that adds 2 tuples.


### [8. More returns!](./8-multiple_returns.py)
* Write a function that returns a tuple with the length of a string and its first character.


### [9. Find the max](./9-max_integer.py)
* Write a function that finds the biggest integer of a list. 


### [10. Only by 2](./10-divisible_by_2.py)
* Write a function that finds all multiples of 2 in a list.


### [11. Delete at](./11-delete_at.py)
* Write a function that deletes the item at a specific position in a list.


### [12. Switch](./12-switch.py)
* Complete the source code in order to switch value of a and b


### [13. Linked list palindrome](./13-is_palindrome.c)
* Technical interview preparation: 


### [14. CPython #0: Python lists](./100-print_python_list_info.c)
* CPython is the reference implementation of the Python programming language. Written in C, CPython is the default and most widely used implementation of the language.
Since we now know a bit of C, we can look at what is happening under the hood of Python. Let’s have fun with Python and C, and let’s look at what makes Python so easy to use.
