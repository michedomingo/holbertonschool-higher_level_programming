# 0x00. Python - Hello, World

<details><summary>Project Requirements ‚òëÔ∏è</summary>

#### Python Scripts
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.4.3)
- All your files should end with a new line
- he first line of all your files should be exactly #!/usr/bin/python3
- A README.md file at the root of the holbertonschool-higher_level_programming repo, containing a description of the repository
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of this project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the PEP 8 style (version 1.7.*)
- All your files must be executable
- The length of your files will be tested using wc
#### Shell Scripts
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your scripts will be tested on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
- All your scripts should be exactly two lines long (wc -l file should print 2)
- All your files should end with a new line
- The first line of all your files should be exactly #!/bin/bash
- All your files must be executable
#### C Scripts
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All your files will be compiled on Ubuntu 14.04 LTS
- Your programs and functions will be compiled with gcc 4.8.4 using the flags -Wall -Werror -Wextra and -pedantic
- All your files should end with a new line
- Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
- You are not allowed to use global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- In the following examples, the main.c files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don‚Äôt have to push them to your repo (if you do we won‚Äôt take them into account). We will use our own main.c files at compilation. Our main.c files might be different from the one shown in the examples
- The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called lists.h
- Don‚Äôt forget to push your header file
- All your header files should be include guarded

## Tasks

### [0. Run Python file](./0-run)
<details><summary>Instructions</summary>

* Write a Shell script that runs a Python script.
* The Python file name will be saved in the environment variable $PYFILE
```
guillaume@ubuntu:~/py/0x00$ cat main.py 
#!/usr/bin/python3
print("Holberton School")

guillaume@ubuntu:~/py/0x00$ export PYFILE=main.py
guillaume@ubuntu:~/py/0x00$ ./0-run
Holberton School
guillaume@ubuntu:~/py/0x00$ 
```
</details>

### [1. Run inline](./1-run_inline)
<details><summary>Instructions</summary>

* Write a Shell script that runs Python code.
* The Python code will be saved in the environment variable $PYCODE
```
guillaume@ubuntu:~/py/0x00$ export PYCODE='print("Holberton School: {}".format(88+10))'
guillaume@ubuntu:~/py/0x00$ ./1-run_inline 
Holberton School: 98
guillaume@ubuntu:~/py/0x00$ 
```
</details>

### [2. Hello, print](./2-print.py)
<details><summary>Instructions</summary>

* Write a Python script that prints exactly "Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle, followed by a new line.
```
guillaume@ubuntu:~/py/0x00$ ./2-print.py 
"Programming is like building a multilingual puzzle
guillaume@ubuntu:~/py/0x00$
```
</details>

### [3. Print integer](./3-print_number.py)
<details><summary>Instructions</summary>

* Complete this source code in order to print the integer stored in the variable number, followed by Battery street, followed by a new line.
```
guillaume@ubuntu:~/py/0x00$ ./3-print_number.py
98 Battery street
guillaume@ubuntu:~/py/0x00$ 
```
> C is strongly typed‚Ä¶ not in Python! The variable number can be assigned to a string, a float, a bool etc‚Ä¶ Forcing the type during a string format ("...".format(...)) is a way to control the type of a variable
